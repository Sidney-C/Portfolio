            <h1>About Me</h1><br></br>
            <p>I am a recent university graduate, looking to launch a career in software development or full-stack web development. I have experience using JavaScript, especially the PERN stack of technologies, including building CRUD web apps using RESTful APIs. I also have a good understanding of Python, and a strong foundation in the principles of Object-Oriented Programming and Usability Engineering.</p>
            <p>I was drawn to programming by my passion for problem-solving and curiosity. I have always tried to use my skills to solve real problems and challenges in my life, from modding video games as a teenager, to more recently completing projects such as a flashcards web app to help myself learn foreign languages, and a Python script to save time when creating React.js projects. You can see evidence of this work in my portfolio. When I am not working on projects like these, I also use sites such as CodeWars to keep my programming skills sharp.</p>
            <p>Apart from my technical skills, I am also a strong communicator. I have successfully worked in diverse teams, both in-person and remotely, and even across countries and time zones. I am confident delivering presentations to large audiences, and advocating for specific solutions.</p><br></br>
